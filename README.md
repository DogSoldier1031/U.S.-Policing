Almost half of Americans have had immediate family incarcerated:

Cops kill an average around 1,000 people per year, THAT WE KNOW OF, we don’t even keep a centralized database, we just “trust” local departments to report their brutality and killings.

They don’t even solve most cases, so they are brutalizing the population while barely fulfilling their supposed roles.

U.S. police fairly regularly stage “slowdowns,” translation they stop even pretending to care about the public when they aren’t being worshipped enough.

Some departments have literally set up black sites, basically our “extraordinary rendition” and “tortured some folk” brought home to roost.

Entire precincts have been known to exhibit unbelievable brutality, as in literally raping prisoners with whatever objects are around.

Police departments regularly strong arm (usually through threats of slowdowns) communities into obscenely overfunding them at the expense of more important and socially beneficial causes, such as schools. On top of George Floyd’s murder, and the enormous amount of horror stories about Minneapolis policing, much of the anger at the 3rd precinct came from the fact it was built using funds redirected from schools in the area.

Many departments are staffed with disproportionate numbers of white suburbanites who travel into the cities to “police” (as in keep “them” in line) cities that are disproportionately populated by low income minorities.

Which is probably why there have been so many white supremacists within U.S. policing.

Which is not at all surprising when U.S. policing was originally conceived for slave patrols, “Indian removal,” and union busting…in other words a force to uphold white supremacy and oppression of the working class. They are literally still catching people to use as slave labor in prisons and “removing,” as in jailing or killing, Indigenous Americans.

If there were really a significant portion of police who disagreed with this type of policing it wouldn’t still be happening after literally hundreds of years of public resistance to it. The “good” cops seem to be rare enough to be of little importance to many of us in the U.S.
